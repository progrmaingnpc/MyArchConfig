### NOTES ###
1. My script does not backup your previous hyprland and hyprland related config files, make sure to move them it to another directory
  to avoid accidently losing it. If you have files with the same name as the ones in:
  a. confs.
  b. scripts.
  c. wallpaper.
  They would be replaced with the config files present in the 3 directories mentioned above
2. I made my configuration is intended for Arch Linux because I use Arch BTW :D.
  I did not test it on other platforms.


### Installation ###
git clone https://github.com/progrmaingnpc/MyArchConfig.git
cd MyArchConfig
./autoconfigure.sh
