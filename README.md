# MyArchConfig
My Arch Linux Hyprland config

![image](https://github.com/progrmaingnpc/MyArchConfig/myconfiguration.png)

## NOTES
1. My script does not backup your previous hyprland config files and hyprland related config files, make sure to move them to another directory, to avoid accidently losing them. If you have files with the same name as the ones in the project's directories please back them up, because they would be replaced with the project's config files
2. My configuration is intended for Arch Linux, because I use Arch BTW :D.
  I did not test it on other platforms.


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/progrmaingnpc/MyArchConfig.git && \
cd MyArchConfig && \
./autoconfigure.sh
```
